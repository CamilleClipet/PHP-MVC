# MVC

The goal of this project was to learn the concept of MVC by making a blog using PHP, without any framework.

## Functionalities
The database of the project includes a table users, a table articles and a table comments.

### Users
There are 3 categories of users: 
* basic users (can read articles + comment articles if they are connected)
* writers (can write articles and edit their own, read articles, comment articles) 
* admin (can read, write, comment, promote other users, delete a user)


### Articles
An article shows his author, the date of creation and edition, its title and content and its comments (comment, date and author of the comment).

### Movies
A movie can be added to a list directly from the movie page or via the edit list page, through a search. The search can be made by title, release date, or genre (one type of search only can be made at a time)
